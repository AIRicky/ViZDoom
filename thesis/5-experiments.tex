\section{Goal of the Experiment}
This chapter shows that using Vizia for AI training is feasible. It was possible to train an AI agent on \"basic\" scenario described in chapter ...section ... <link> 

\section{AI Agent Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item python, theano, lasagne
\item Based on Google's DeepMind Atari DQN.
\item Q learning, convolutional neural network, eps-greedy policy with linear epsilon decay, action replay
\item pseudo code here? (ommit if short on time)
\item network architecture used in the experiment, fancy diagram of this architecture here? (there are 2 conv and 2 mlp layers so it can be drawn and still make sense)
\end{itemize}
