\chapter{Experiments}
This chapter shows that using Vizia for AI training is feasible. It was possible to train an AI agent on \"basic\" scenario described in chapter ...section ... <link> 

\section{Setting} 
what (and how) will be tested. Overall performance, training speed (time and learning steps) for different frame skiprates was suggested.
Hardware used for the experiment.

\section{AI Agent Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item python, theano, lasagne
\item Based on Google's DeepMind Atari DQN.
\item Q learning, convolutional neural network, eps-greedy policy with linear epsilon decay, action replay
\item pseudo code here?
\item network architecture used in the experiment, fancy diagram of this architecture here? (there are 2 conv and 2 mlp layers so it can be drawn and still make sense)
\end{itemize}
