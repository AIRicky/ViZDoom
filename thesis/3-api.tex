\chapter{Application Programming Interface}
This chapter desribes C++ api of the framework. \"Methods\"" and \"Structures and Enumerations\"" sections describe methods and structures exposed by api along with short examples if needed. \"Python wrapper\" outlines differences between C++ and Python Api. \"Extended examples\" sections shows fully functional examples in a proper context.

\section{Methods}
All that is written in README (the api part) but nicer, more thorough and with examples
\section{Structures and Enumerations}
Just like above
\begin{itemize}
\item struct state
\item enumeration types . . .or maybe move it to the apendinx?
\end{itemize}

\section{Python Wrapper}

\begin{itemize}
\item naming convention is underscore not camelcase for all methods except for the constructor
\item State is changed structuraly: bufer is a numpy array and game variables are a Python list.
\item getState COPIES the buffer and gameVariables, it doesn't happen in cpp. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Extended Examples}
