   abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

abstract = {This paper describes an architecture for controlling non-player characters (NPC) in the First Person Shooter (FPS) game Unreal Tournament 2004. Specifically, the DRE-Bot architecture is made up of three reinforcement learners, Danger, Replenish and Explore, which use the tabular Sarsa($\lambda$) algorithm. This algorithm enables the NPC to learn through trial and error building up experience over time in an approach inspired by human learning. Experimentation is carried to measure the performance of DRE-Bot when competing against fixed strategy bots that ship with the game. The discount parameter, $\gamma$, and the trace parameter, $\lambda$, are also varied to see if their values have an effect on the performance.},

abstract = {A well-known Artificial Intelligence (AI) problem in video games is designing AI-controlled humanoid characters. It is desirable for these characters to appear both skillful and believably human-like. Many games address the former objective by providing their agents with unfair advantages. Although challenging, these agents are frustrating to humans who perceive the AI to be cheating. In this paper we evaluate hidden semi-Markov models and particle filters as a means for predicting opponent positions. Our results show that these models can perform with similar or better accuracy than the average human expert in the game Counter-Strike: Source. Furthermore, the mistakes these models make are more human-like than perfect predictions.},
