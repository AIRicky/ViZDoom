\section{Motivation}
TODO
Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks have become very popular in the last couple of years. DeepMind is a huge inspiration. Only 2D games have been researched so far, that's why we want to create a framework using 3D environment. Games are great for simulating 3 dimensional world and are perfect setting for Reinforcement Learning.\\
Stuff to mention:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deep Neural Networks
	\item Visual Learning, Convolutional Nets, AI
	\item Reinforcement Learning
	\item DeppMind atari
	\item 2D and 3D games
\end{itemize}

\section{Aims and scope}
TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item opensource lightweight, 3d, fps game/engine,
	\item total control over the game processing,
	\item customizable resolution, rendering parameters ets
	\item spectator mode (human is playing, agent is watching),
	\item custom scenarios support abd creation,
	\item reinforcement learning firendly API (state, action, reward),
	\item support for Linux, Windows, OS X, main focus on Linux,
	\item C++ core, API in python, perhaps in lua, java etc.
\end{itemize}
