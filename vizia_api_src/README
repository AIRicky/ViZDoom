Troubleshooting:
1. /usr/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory
 # include <pyconfig.h>
                       ^

add this to .bashrc:
if [[ $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="" ]];
then
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7
else
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH;/usr/include/python2.7"

Change /usr/include/python2.7 to yout python include path.
