Prerequisites:
• preferably Linux
• cmake
• make
• gcc 4.??
• Boost
• Python 2.6+ with Numpy and Boost.Python (for pyhon binding)
• Java compiler (for Java binding)

Before building (needed for zdoom):
	Debian/Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libsdl2-dev libjpeg-dev nasm tar libbz2-dev libgtk2.0-dev cmake git libfluidsynth-dev libgme-dev libopenal-dev timidity

	Fedora:
	yum install gcc-c++ make zlib-devel SDL2-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel nasm tar bzip2-devel gtk2-devel cmake git fluidsynth-devel game-music-emu-devel	openal-soft-devel timidity++

	Arch linux:
	pacman -S --needed gcc make zlib sdl2 libjpeg-turbo nasm tar bzip2 gtk2 cmake git fluidsynth libgme fmodex openal timidity++
	
	openSUSE:
	zypper install gcc-c++ make zlib-devel libSDL2-devel libjpeg-devel nasm tar libbz2-devel gtk2-devel cmake git fluidsynth-devel libgme-devel openal-soft-devel timidity

Building steps:
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make all

Everything will be built in bin directory.

Troubleshooting:
1. /usr/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory
 # include <pyconfig.h>
                       ^
compilation terminated.

add this to .bashrc:
if [[ $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="" ]];
then
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7
else
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH;/usr/include/python2.7"
fi

Change /usr/include/python2.7 to your python include path.
